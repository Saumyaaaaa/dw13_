in package json add 
    "type":"module",
if we do so, js will support import ,export feature


frontend requests backend request are:(CRUD)
    create -> post
    read    -> get
    update  ->patch
    delete  ->delete


Making API means frontend request backend 
                and
 backend does the task according to the request


 To request we need url and method



 url=localhost:8000/trainees/123?name=nitan & age=30 & address=gagalfeddi
 url=route?query
 route=baseUrl + routeParams



one request must have one response


middleware  
    function which has request,res,next are called middlewares
    next() is used to trigger another middleware


                Two types of Middleware base on error

normal middleware= (req,res,next)=>{} to trigger another middleware we call next()
error middleware= (err,req,res,next)=>{} to trigger another middleware we call next(data)


                Two types of Middleware base on location

route middleware => defined in route
application middleware => define in index.js (or main file)




we have to define structure of data 

define array (model) 
name object
define object (schema)




Rules of Model 
    variable name must be same as model name
    model name must be of first letter capital
    model name must be singular



To make a CRUD
    1 schema
    2 model
    3 controller
    3 route
    4 index 


////in Searching type doesn't matter
